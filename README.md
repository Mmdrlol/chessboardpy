## General info
Here's my real first projet in python and I'm very proud of it ;)
This project has a interactive board made with tkinter.
I tried to make ```board.py``` as general as possible so that it can be used in other projects!!!

## Features
- Graphic Animations
- Castlings, En Passant Captures and Pawn Promotions
- Control check, occupied squares and pins to limit pieces' moves
- Detect checkmate and draw like stalemate
- Save two players' moves in a list

### To Do:
- add comments and make the code more readable
- put choices for the Pawn's promotion
- maybe add a timer with the players' moves and buttons to replay and give up
